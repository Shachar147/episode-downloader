# Match subtitles and video
can we choose the torrent and the subtitles based on the ones with the best match?

I mean, if we choose to download video of Rick.And.Morty.S05E01.1080p and we found subtitles for 480p it might not match and subtitles won't be good.

# Send updates to Slack
- once torrent was found
- once subtitles were found / not found
- once it was merged

# Daily / Semi-Daily CronJob
Run it once/twice a day so once there's available episode it'll download it

# Upload it somewhere
- for streaming online
- maybe create a React website that shows the data?

# Accepts commands from Slack
- User should be able to send requests for series and script will listen, search, and respond
